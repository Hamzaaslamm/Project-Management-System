# Project-Management-System
Project management system simplifies project handling by allowing users to choose a category (basic, standard, premium), provide project details, and requirements. The manager assigns tasks, updates progress, and collaborates with the customer on deadlines. Customers can pay online, while the owner can track all project statuses.
